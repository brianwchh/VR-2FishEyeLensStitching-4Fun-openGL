in this project, I am going to show how to stitch two fisheye images into a 360 panoramic picture , you don't have to layout your own PCB, instead just use the products out in the market as the prototype model to play with your stitching ideas ,calibrate it and then write some code in openGL to stitch them into a panoramic view, further, if you like, you can convert your ideas from openGL to cuda code ....  for fun !
